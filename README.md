# DelphiEmailSender

I wanted to create a project that uses Interfaces and unit testing and maybe integration testing.

This project is more about learning how to code better rather than actually sending the emails.

However the point of this project is to send emails so 
I will start off with basic MAPI and then move on to INDY and see how were going after that
